# Code for Change - Shine On! Kids

This is the Code for Change 2017 project for Shine On! Kids (http://sokids.org/).

Scope of Work:

**Enhancement of the current Beads Inventory Application (Platform: Web)​**
* Order Sheet​
  * Generate order sheet with # of orders automatically. SOK puts # of orders in the order sheet manually now. The sheet is used by Volunteers to pack beads and track back-orders​
* Delivery Sheet​
  * Generate delivery sheet automatically. SOK does not attach the delivery sheet to hospital now

**Beads Order Screen for Hospitals (Platform: Web)**
* Beads Order Screen​
  * Create a screen for hospitals to order beads. Hospitals order beads to SOK by mail or phone now​
* Order Status Screen​
  * Create a screen to refer order history and delivery/backorder status​
* “Beads of Courage” Activities Tracking Screen​
  * Create a screen to track “Beads of Courage” activities - how many patients (without name) participate in this program, and duration etc.​

**Donors Management Tool (Platform: Web)​**
* Confirmation Mail​
  * Send a confirmation mail when “Team Beads of Courage” registration is done. Google Form is now used for registration. Donors sometimes register multiple times by mistake, because no confirmation is sent​
* Delivery Mail​
  * Implement a function to generate/send mails automatically. When a donor registers “Team Beads of Courage” program, SOK delivers 2 beads to the donor after 3,000yen donation.  When SOK sends beads to donors, they need to create/send mails one by one now. ​
* Donors Management Screen​
  * When the same donors register the program multiple times, it is recorded as a new line at the bottom of Google Form. Therefore, it’s difficult to track who registers how many times​
  * Add a sequence no for each donor so that they can manage the history of donation / activities etc.​
  * Shine On! Kids send a strap when the same donor registers the program 10 times, but it is currently difficult to manage the counts
